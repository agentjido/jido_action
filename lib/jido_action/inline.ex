defmodule Jido.Action.Inline do
  @moduledoc """
  Compile-time inline Action support for host DSLs.

  Call `use Jido.Action.Inline` in each owner module. A host macro then:

  1. Calls `parse_bound!/3` or `parse_callback!/3` for the slot's input mode.
  2. Parses and validates `params_ast` with its own expression adapter in bound mode.
  3. Calls `compile!/4` and emits `declaration_ast` at the declaration site.
  4. Uses `target_ast` after that declaration AST to store an ordinary Action target.

  For example, a host can use the path
  `[host: MyApp.DSL, declaration: "greet", role: :action]`. It can later call
  `target!(Owner, path)` to retrieve only the target, without the source mapping.
  Nested declarations add typed segments, such as `choice: "route"` and
  `option: "otherwise"`. An option and a fallback must have different paths.

  Paths and Action metadata are separate. The host supplies a default metadata
  name; a declaration can override it with `name:`. Generated module names are
  implementation details, not public names or code versions.

  Bodies keep the owner's lexical scope and private helpers. Deploy the owner
  and generated Action BEAM files together. Lookup is available only after the
  owner compiles. It does not execute work or create atoms. Do not pass runtime
  or stored code to the compile-time APIs.

  This API is unreleased; it is not part of `3.0.0-beta.5`. See
  [Portable Inline Actions](inline-actions.md) for a complete public-only host
  with bound input, callback input, schemas, execution context, and lookup.

  Parses named bindings, a binding list, a sole map binding, or `[]`.

  A named binding is `value <- source`. A list groups named bindings. A sole
  map binding, such as `%{name: name} <- source`, uses the complete source as
  Action params. `[]` produces an empty parameter map. Duplicate names, mixed
  map and named bindings, bare `_`, pins, guards, and top-level struct patterns
  are not supported.

  Options:

  - `do:` is the required Action body.
  - `name:` overrides the host's default public Action name, not its identity.
  - `description:` sets public Action metadata; it defaults to `nil`.
  - `schema:` and `output_schema:` use static Action schemas and default to
    `[]`. Schemas are not inferred from patterns. Input defaults apply before
    the body matches its parameters.
  - `context: named_variable` binds actual callback context without adding a
    parameter or a schema field. It must not collide with a pattern variable.

  Parsing checks header and option shape only. The host must parse and
  validate the returned source AST before calling `compile!/4`. The parser
  does not expand or evaluate source calls. Bindings belong to the host's
  parameter mapping; they are not retained by an extracted Action target.

  Raises `CompileError` for an invalid header or option, at the source location.

  Builds declaration and target AST inside a compiling owner module.

  `path_ast` must evaluate to a typed path with a host namespace, one or more
  declaration segments, and a final role. Each segment is an atom key paired
  with a non-nil atom, string, or integer. The path is evaluated once, when the
  emitted declaration executes. A false compile-time branch creates no target.

  Options:

  - `default_name:` is metadata AST used when the parsed options omit `name:`.
    Supply it unless the declaration has an explicit name.
  - `remove_imports:` lists exact declaration-only imports to remove from the
    body. Other imports remain available. The default is `[]`.

  Metadata and schemas evaluate in the owner at the declaration site, under
  normal Action configuration and static-schema rules. `context:` binds the
  actual callback context without changing parameters or schemas.
