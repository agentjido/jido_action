defmodule Jido.Expr do
  @moduledoc """
  Small, data-only expressions for limited use in Flow DSLs.

  Use `Jido.Expr` for simple conditions and calculations in Flow parameters,
  outputs, and other DSL fields. It is not a general Elixir evaluator or a
  general-purpose expression language. Expressions contain fixed operators
  and data. They never contain executable callbacks.

  Other small, data-only DSLs can use the same syntax through `parse/2`. Each
  host supplies its own reference parser, validator, and resolver. These
  callbacks can handle leaf values. They cannot add operators. This module
  does not depend on a host package or a reference namespace.

  ## Author expressions

      import Jido.Expr, only: [expr: 1]

      calculation = expr(2 * 3 + 1)
      {:ok, 7} = Jido.Expr.evaluate(calculation)

  Use `^value` in `expr/1` to insert a prebuilt value or host reference from
  an Elixir variable. This is a trusted source-code boundary, not stored
  expression syntax. Application calls, including calls inside a pin, are
  rejected. A host parser does not accept pins by default.

  The grammar is a small subset of Elixir expression syntax. It supports `==`,
  `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `in`, `and`, `or`, `not`, `+`, binary and unary
  `-`, `*`, `/`, `div/2`, `rem/2`, `min/2`, `max/2`, `abs/1`, and `<>`.
  Conformance tests list every accepted spelling and compare each supported
  operation with the equivalent Elixir expression. These tests enforce
  consistent syntax, precedence, grouping, and success or failure behavior
  for the supported subset.

  `and` and `or` require a Boolean left operand, short-circuit, and return the
  evaluated right operand unchanged. `not` requires a Boolean. Parentheses
  preserve native grouping and precedence; binary Boolean groups are not
  flattened.

  Equality uses `==`; list membership uses strict `===` and requires a proper
  list. Ordering and `min`/`max` use Elixir term order, including mixed types.
  Arithmetic accepts numbers; `div` and `rem` require integers. Concatenation
  accepts binaries. There is no implicit conversion.

  Literal data consists of atoms (including nil and Booleans), numbers,
  binaries, proper lists, and maps with atom, integer, or binary keys. Host
  references can supply data within the host's contract and the limits below.
  Unsupported source forms, including tuples, ranges, arbitrary calls, unary
  `+`, `&&`, `||`, and strict equality syntax, are rejected.

  ## Resource limits

  `parse/2`, `validate/2`, and `evaluate/2` accept positive integer limits:

  * `:max_depth` defaults to 64 nested data or expression levels.
  * `:max_nodes` defaults to 10,000 visited values, including resolved data
    and comparison work during evaluation.
  * `:max_binary_bytes` defaults to 1,048,576 cumulative bytes in visited
    binaries and generated results.
  * `:max_integer_bits` defaults to 4,096 bits in each integer magnitude.

  Limits cannot exceed 1,048,576,000. `:max_integer_bits` has a lower maximum
  of 1,048,576 to keep the limit check itself bounded.

  Limits apply to each call. Skipped operands are not resolved or evaluated.
  Validation checks the complete tree. Resolve and validation callbacks belong
  to trusted host code and must themselves be bounded.
  Resolved values are checked as data and are never evaluated as expressions.
